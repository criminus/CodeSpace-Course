# Challenge: eCommerce
In this challenge we have to create a eCommerge website with basic functions.

## Key Features:
* User Registration and Authentication:
    * Users can create a new account by providing necessary details (e.g., name, email, password).
    * Implement user authentication to allow registered users to securely log in.
* Product Catalogue:
    * Display a range of products on the website categorized by type (e.g., watches).
    * Each product should have a detailed page showing its description, price, and other relevant information.
* Shopping Cart:
    * Allow users to add products to a shopping cart and update quantities or remove items.
    * Display the contents of the cart, including the total price.
* Checkout Process:
    * Enable users to proceed to checkout from the shopping cart.
* Database Integration (SQL):
    * Use SQL to design and manage the database for storing user accounts, product details, cart items, and orders.
    * Implement SQL queries to retrieve and update data as required by the website's functionalities.
* Responsive Design with Bootstrap:
    * Ensure the website is responsive and mobile-friendly using Bootstrap framework for front-end development.
    * Design a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and interaction.

## Requirements
* Bootstrap (front-end)
* SQL (Database)
* PHP (back-end)

## Additional info
* I will use Twig as template engine and PDO for database (I find it easier to work with).
